# python-microbilt

An unofficial, unsupported, work-in-progress API wrapper for Microbilt's APIs for python

See the tests for examples, no support will be given (I hate python)

Supported operations:
    * ABAAcctVerification(self, routing_number, account_number)
    * AddressStandardization(self, address1, city, state, zip_code)
